# Crash Announcer Plugin

**Crash Announcer** is a PocketMine-MP plugin that automatically sends detailed crash reports to a specified Discord channel through a webhook when an error or crash occurs on your server. This helps server administrators quickly identify and resolve issues.

---

## Features

- **Automatic crash detection**: Detects and reports both runtime errors and fatal errors.
- **Detailed crash reports**: Reports include error message, file, line number, and server information.
- **Customizable Discord embed**: You can fully customize the appearance of the embed message sent to your Discord webhook.
- **Lightweight and easy to use**: Minimal setup required, designed for efficient performance.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin's `.phar` file and place it in the `plugins` folder of your PocketMine-MP server.
2. Start the server to generate the configuration file.
3. Open the `config.yml` file located in the `plugins/CrashAnnouncer` folder and configure it according to your preferences.

## Configuration (`config.yml`)

```yaml
# Discord webhook URL where crash reports will be sent
webhook-url: "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"

# Embed message customization
embed-title: "Server Crash Report"
embed-description: "A crash occurred on your server. Details are provided below."
embed-color: "#FF0000"  # Hexadecimal color code for embed

# Plugin messages
messages:
  plugin-enabled: "Crash Announcer enabled."
  error-webhook: "Failed to send crash report to the webhook."
```

## How It Works

1. **Error Handling**  
   The plugin uses `set_error_handler` and `register_shutdown_function` to detect errors and crashes:
   - `handleCrash`: Captures non-fatal errors and sends a report.
   - `handleFatalError`: Captures fatal errors and sends a report before the server shuts down.

2. **Sending Reports**  
   When an error or crash is detected, the plugin sends a detailed report to the configured Discord webhook. The report includes:
   - Error message, file, and line number
   - Server information (OS, PocketMine version, and number of online players)
   - Timestamp of the crash
